A webpage where you can doodle on a custom grid.
  * 1- You can change the number of pixels(divs) in the grid by changing the value of the slider on the top.
  * 2- Click or Drag on the grid to draw.
  * 3- `Black` is the default color, you can change your default color by clicking on the `Custom` button.
  * 4- `Eraser` and `Reset` can help you clean the grid.
  
#### That's everything. There are more buttons with cool features, play with them to find out what they do.

Will add a backend where the progress can be saved locally on the broweser.
